# Luxpower Dongle Server

## Description

The Luxpower Dongle Server is designed to interface with BH/BG serial number dongles, providing a secure, local connection to Home Assistant. This solution enhances network security by limiting the data sent externally, ensuring that all information remains within your local network.

For the server to operate, an external device must be purchased separately from [Monitor My Solar](https://monitormy.solar). This device acts as a relay between the dongle and your Home Assistant setup.
